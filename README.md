# AgentBasedModel
This is a repository for assessment 1 of GEOG5995: Programming for Social Scientists taught by Dr Andrew Evans at the University of Leeds.

It contains the main model file, the agent framework class file and the environment file 'in.txt'. To run, all files need to be saved to the same directory.

The agents run through a user-defined series of iterations, moving randomly around their environment consuming resources and sharing them when they encounter another agent in their field of proximity.
